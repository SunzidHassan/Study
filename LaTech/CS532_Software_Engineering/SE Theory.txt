SDLC
5 - Who are the stakeholders?
 Product Owner(Holds Product Backlog)
 Executive
 Marketing(You cant sell it, If you cant market it)
 Technical Lead (Technical architecture, constraints, 20 years experience )
Developer
Customer
Project Manager or Scrum Master(Who manages all the deadlines, infra, looks for all the project)
Testing/QA- to test and find bugs, and document them and report those to developers


6 - What are their responsibilities?
7 - What are the steps? Can you recognize them?
Requirements
Analysis(Prune, elaborate)
Prototyping:Validation  (Usabilitytest)
Build
Test(Bug Test)
Deploy
Document
Maintainance
8 - What's in a product backlog? a release backlog?
Product backlog  contains both user critical feautues and technical requirements
Release Backlog contains the commited features and requirements

9 - What are the characteristics of linear projects?
	Project is a combination of sequence of tasks, where one task restricts the start of other task
		(These projects require schedules that maintain resource continuity for an activity from one unit to the next one and achieve logic constraints at the same time)
10 - What are some of the different types of testing?
	Manual Vs Automatic testing
	
	Automatic Testing tools
	Eg:  Developer testing tools Q-Unit, J-Unit, Post Testing team- Selenium
	
	- Unit Testing
	- Integration tests
	-Functional Tests
	-End to end tests
	-Acceptance tests
	-Performance testing
	-Smoke Testing
	-Exploratory testing

11 - What are QA's deliverables?
E.g.: bugs, risk analysis, advice on quality practices tailored to that company or team, metrics, and tools to gain quality information automatically.

link use cases/user stories to test cases covering them and report their status
list which test cases are automated and why those cases were automated (in general the scenarios that are most likely to get the heaviest use are the best candidates for automation)
the state of overall product regression if you have it (this is particularly important when you're dealing with development against an existing product)
areas that weren't tested, the reasons these were not tested, and the potential risks exposed. It's very rare that everything can be tested, so there's always going to be a need for testing triage.

ref https://sqa.stackexchange.com/questions/7518/what-are-the-deliverables-of-the-qa-department



12 - What's a post mortem? Who's it for?
POSTMORTEM - Complete In-Depth Documentation of everything,, all the decisions made during the project

13 - What are the considerations of software after ship?

%%Maintainance%%
Security Threats
Hardware Changes
Orientation of libraries
Critical bugs


AGILE

16 - Can you recognize or elaborate the differences between incremental and iterative? waterfall? agile?
	%%WATERFALL%% - Old SChool"Nobody follows it now"

-Requirements are known
-Requirements wont change
-Deliver Once

Eg- Buidling a Cake


%%Iterative Development%%

-Changing
- Many Unknown Requirements
-Deliver Many/Multiple Times
-Change/Improve/move toward target with each iteration 

 
Eg: The perfect Steak Recipie 
Eg: Game development(Version based Improvement)

%%Incremental Development%%

-Large Project
-Delivered in fully functional Pieces
- Delivered over a period of time
-Few Unknowns or changing requirements



 %%Agile(Iterative,Incremental)%%

18 - Can you differentiate between different examples?
19 - Do you understand the tenets of the Agile Manifesto?
-Individuals and interactions over processes and tools(Face-face Interactions)
-Working software over comprehensive documentation(always working on a central Build)
-Customer collaboration over contract negotiation(Involve the customer in the process)
-Responding to change over following a plan(Embrace regular change of requirements)

	
SCRUM

22 - Who's on the team?
Developer, ProductOwner, SCrum Master, Testing/QA, Customer/User(Not always the same)


23 - What are their roles and responsibilities?
24 - Do you understand the goals of release planning?

Release Schedule is limited from today to the commited delivery time
Release Schedule is filled with Sprints and Gates

25 - What is a release? a gate? a sprint?
For eg, if the Schedule is a 4 and half month stretch,
4 1/2 is divided with 3 gates and each gate has 3 sprints i.e each sprint has perfect 2 weeks

26 - How/ when does alpha fit in? What are the goals of alpha?

after the last gate, ALPHA phase begins, in which ,only testing happens(No New features are added, code merge,Impediment orientation, testing bugs)

27 - What kinds of projects have shorter or longer sprints?
ref https://hygger.io/blog/quick-guide-choosing-right-sprint-length-project/#longer-sprints-vs-shorter-sprints

28 - Can you write good user stories? recognize good user stories?
		should have the "Accurate empathy"
1) Elicitation (Asking really Good questions; Documenting in the others language)
2) Clarification/elaboration
3)Prioritization
4)Validation 	
		eg:https://blogs.itemis.com/en/what-are-good-user-stories#:~:text=The%20story%20always%20elaborates%20an,the%20user%2C%20customer%20or%20client.&text=The%20story%20is%20quantifiable%3A%20it,team%20to%20appreciate%20its%20scope.&text=The%20story%20is%20the%20right%20size.&text=The%20story%20contains%20enough%20information%20to%20allow%20it%20to%20be%20tested
		
		

29 - What are the components/ characteristics of a sprint?
Sprint Planning
Execution
The Sprint Review
Sprint Retrospective

ref : https://www.projectengineer.net/the-4-parts-of-a-sprint-in-agile/
30 - What types of work aren't great for agile or scrum?
31 - What events occur in 1 sprint?
Sprint Planning
Execution
The Sprint Review
Sprint Retrospective

32 - What happens at retrospective? after?
Features feedback from customer,
Clarifications on the sprint development
Make some changes in priorities,
Next to Retrospective is Sprint Planning

33 - What takes place on planning day? What are the outcomes of sprint planning?
- Tasks
- Story Pooints
- Estimates

34 - Can you calculate hours for one developer's work?

Add up all the User stories  developer has worked,

estimated + 20% is Good
Estomated + 15% is excellent
Estimate without any variation is (MI)

35 - Can you identify/calculate velocity?
Velocity- Average Hrs/Day
Average work remaining calculation according to the burndown chart

AVerage velocity =  Number of story points/No of sprints

ref: https://premieragile.com/how-to-improve-velocity-in-scrum/

36 - Can you identify technical debt?
%%TECHNICAL DEBT%%
The work that is pending on the last day of the sprint, i.e due deadline 

Velocity- Average Hrs/Day
Average work remaining calculation according to the burndown chart

which is very essential to calculate the technical debt

Eg: is 20/896 work hrs of technical debt present, 876/896 work hours are remaining for the next sprints




37 - What makes a good standup? a bad standup?
-dev's + management
-10min tops
-dont solvve the problems
-Same time,Place everyday


What do you do?
What are you going to do?
Are there any blocking issues?

Bad Standup - No Technical Discussion/ Long calls are not allowed

39 REQUIREMENTS
40 - What are the characteristics of the steps?
41 - What are different types of requirements?
User and system requirements
42 - What are some user requirement tools?
Mock Up Interviews
	Continue WalkRound
	Market Research
	Ethitographic Research
	Surveys
43 - What philosophies or mindsets govern finding requirements?
-Developing Accurate Empathy
-Task Analysis
-Interviews
-Market Maping

44 - Who captures requirements? From whom?
User requirements are captured from (Product owner)
System Requirements are caputed from(Developer, Technical Lead)

45 - What's gold plating?
- Extra Unexpected developments which are out of scope, and this can utilize more time than Sprint time
-Gold plating, on the other hand, is when a project team adds on features that were not requested by the client. 
The reasons for gold plating can vary. 
Sometimes this is done to gain the approval of a client or internal management. This is also occasionally done to draw attention away from project defects. 


46 - What's scope creep?
-In project management, scope creep is when extra features are added to a project at the request of a client. This can occur when the scope is hazily defined or agreed upon informally.\
 Scope creep can cause costs to spiral and should be avoided.
