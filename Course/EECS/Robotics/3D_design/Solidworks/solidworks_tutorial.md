### Welcome Screen:
  - `Parts` are used for 2D drawing or single 3D components.
  - `Assembly` is for combining these 3D parts together.
  - `Drawing` is to get 2D description of a 3D component.

### Interface and Project Properties
- Interface
  - The Tab Headers are called the `Command Manager`, that contains main tools to draw and edit.
  - On right it has `Panels` divided in `Sections` for additional options.
  - `View` tab > `Toolbars` further tools.

- At first, we need to setup some properties, like units to use. By clicking on `Options` on top to adjust either `System Options` or document specific `Document Properties` options.
  - Like setting systemwide dark theme.
  - Or document units to use, or how to show measurement in details.

### Project Components
- In a `Parts` project, we can drop 3D objects called `Features` in 2D drawings called `Sketches`, starting with elements like lines and curves called `Entities`.
- `Sketch` section contains tools for 2D drawing. After choosing a tool, we need to select a `Plane`, which can be changed from `Quick Settings`. The suggestion is to draw 2D objects on a `Top Plane` - which represents the ground plane.
- With the `Line` tool, we can click to connect multiple lines, hitting `Esc` or double click to finish. We can hit `Enter` to recall latest tool.
- The `Spline` tool is used for curves.
- The `Arc` - one click for radius, other click for arc length. `Circle` uses one click for radius. `Ellipse` uses 2 clicks for radius and elongation.
- The `Rectangle` and `Polygon` for creating regular shapes.
- Tool down arrow shows more drawing options. Hovering over tool buttons shows tips.
